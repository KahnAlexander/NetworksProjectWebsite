					Project Introduction
				</h2>
                <p>
                    For our research project, the initial question we wanted to
					answer was if there is a correlation between the quality of
					school a student attends to the quality of food available to
					those students. If we found that there was a correlation,
					was it directly related to the school levels being affected
					by income level? This project will show if lower-level
					college campuses are targeted by lower-cost fast food
					chains, and if higher-level schools are more surrounded by
					higher quality food establishments.
                </p>
                <hr>

					Project Plan
				</h2>
                <p>
                    To answer this question, our team gathered data based on two
					different categories: school levels and food quality.
					The first category is discrete with values of:
					<bl>
						<li>Community College</li>
						<li>State University</li>
						<li>Private University</li>
						<li>Ivy League</li>
					</bl>
					<br>
					And the second category is also discrete wth values:
					<bl>
						<li>Fast Food</li>
						<li>Sitdown Restaurant</li>
						<li>Grocery Store</li>
					</bl>
					<br>
					The other metrics we chose to measure by were the distance
					from a campus to some food establishment, chosen from a list
					of entries in the three food categories, and lists of school
					campuses compiled for each level.

							Global metric

							<img src="global.PNG" alt="Global metric">

						This metric shows what proportion of the overall list of
						requests were found near that campus. This globally
						compares campuses' scores in categories to each other,
						based on who found a certain ratio of the request list.

							Local metric
						</h2>

						<figure>

						This metric shows what proportion of a food category
						near a campus is made up of each category. This locally
						measures scores, finding what percentage of food
						businesses near a campus are made up of a category.
